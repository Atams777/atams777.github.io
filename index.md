# Who am I:

Father of two, Husband, Software Developer. Outside of work I enjoy video games, reading, movies, camping... I suppose nothing terribly surprising given my profession.

I took my first coding class in Highschool (VB), started my first programing job in college (2007), and graduated college in 2009. To save you the math that's about 14 years as of 2021 

# What is this site:

This site is for the most part and excuse for me to work with stuff outside of my day job.

Hosting websites on GitHub, playing with some Java code, Google Analytics, etc.

# What will you find on here:

A link to my GitHub page, where I'll probably post some basic code.

I'm trying to write a book, so maybe I'll add a progress monitor on here for it, and some rough draft chapters.

# Anything else?

Honestly that's about it, I've only had the domain and pages for a bit, and I'm really just playing around with it for now.
